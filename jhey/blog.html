                <h1>Major Milestone Achieved in New Quantum Computing Architecture</h1>
                <p>
                    Coherence stands as a pillar of effective communication, whether it is in writing, speaking or
                    information processing. This principle extends to quantum bits, or qubits, the building blocks
                    of quantum computing. A quantum computer could one day tackle previously insurmountable
                    challenges in climate prediction, material design, drug discovery and more.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>A team led by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Argonne National Laboratory has achieved a
                    major milestone toward future quantum computing. They have extended the coherence time for their
                    novel type of qubit to an impressive 0.1 milliseconds nearly a thousand times better than the
                    previous record.
                </p>
                <p>In everyday life, 0.1 milliseconds is as fleeting as a blink of an eye. However, in the quantum
                    world, it represents a long enough window for a qubit to perform many thousands of operations.
                    Unlike classical bits, qubits seemingly can exist in both states, 0 and 1. For any working
                    qubit, maintaining this mixed state for a sufficiently long coherence time is imperative. The
                    challenge is to safeguard the qubit against the constant barrage of disruptive noise from the
                    surrounding environment.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>The team's qubits encode quantum information in the electron's motional (charge) states. Because
                    of that, they are called charge qubits. "Among various existing qubits, electron charge qubits
                    are especially attractive because of their simplicity in fabrication and operation, as well as
                    compatibility with existing infrastructures for classical computers," said Dafei Jin, a
                    professor at the University of Notre Dame with a joint appointment at Argonne and the lead
                    investigator of the project. "This simplicity should translate into low cost in building and
                    running large-scale quantum computers."
                    Jin is a former staff scientist at the Center for Nanoscale Materials (CNM), a DOE Office of
                    Science user facility at Argonne. While there, he led the discovery of their new type of qubit,
                    reported last year.
                    <br>
                    The team's qubit is a single electron trapped on an ultraclean solid-neon surface in a vacuum.
                    The neon is important because it resists disturbance from the surrounding environment. Neon is
                    one of a handful of elements that do not react with other elements. The neon platform keeps the
                    electron qubit protected and inherently guarantees a long coherence time.
